# 8th June: Started Working on the PCB!
- Ok so I wrote this on my notes app when i started because I was too tired to start a new repo but here we go:
- I worked on something really simple, a flower necklace
- This is what I have rn! It's gonna be cr1220 powered with some small LEDs in parallel (sorry Ducc)
- I spent wayyy to much time on / found hardest finding what resistor works because apparently i cant use V=IR and drawing the flower because this isnt like KiCad </3

**Total time spent: ~2h**

  # 10th June: Finalising
- Today I learnt I hate routing...DRC errors make me go crazy.
- I also learnt I don't like using VIAs
- But outside the struggle, I did it!
